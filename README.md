# Natural Language Processing with Python
Working with Natural Language Processing with Python.

### Python
- Python is an easy to learn, widely used general-purpose, high-level powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
- Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
- The Python works and drive on it's reliable "Python Interpreter" and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed.
- History:
  - Python was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 by [Guido van Rossum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
  - Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).
- Features and Philosophy:
  - Python is a multi-paradigm programming language:
    - object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and
    - there are a number of language features which support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and by magic methods).
    - Many other paradigms are supported using extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.
  - Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.
  - An important feature of Python is dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.
